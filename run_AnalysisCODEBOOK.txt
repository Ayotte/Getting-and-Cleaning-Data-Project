CODEBOOK

run_Analysis.R manipulates the data from Version 1.0 of the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" data collected by 
Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Oneto of Smartlab Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory

The data was collected with a group of 30 volunteers between the ages of 19-48.  Each person performed six activities with a Samsung Galaxy S II on their waist.  The data was collected with the phone's accelerometer and gyroscope.
The data was split into two sets - 70% of it in the "train" set and the rest in the "test" set.

The run_Analysis script will perform the following actions in order to clean up the accelerometer/gyroscopic data collected from Samsung phones.

It will read in the following six tables and then merge them into two frames - one for the test data and one for train.
/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt
/UCI HAR Dataset/train/x_train.txt
/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt
/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt
/UCI HAR Dataset/test/x_test.txt
/UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt

At that point, it will retrieve column names from the /UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt file and apply it to each data frame, along with a variable name subjects and activities.

The two dataframes will then be put on top of each other so that there is only one column for subject and one for activity.  Since the test
and the train data were gathered with the same method, there's no reason to have separate tables for each.

Once we're down to a single data frame, we will create a new data frame with only the variables for subject, activity, and
the mean and standard deviation of each acceleration, gyroscopic, jerk, and FFT measurement, sorted in such a way that all means
and all standard deviations are together

It will then call the Activitytransform function rename each activity according to the names given in /UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt

The script will then melt the dataframe so that Subject and Activity are the only id variables and the rest are measurements, so that it can
then be casted into one row per subject-activity pair with each other variable being the mean of each measurement for that pair.

It will then write out a table to finaldata.txt in your working directory.  This file will have 68 columns.

Subject is the assigned number of each of the 30 volunteers
Activity is the activity that the subject performed of the six possibilities.
The remaining 66 columns display the average value of the following measurements for each iteration of an activity by each subject.

"-XYZ" denotes that there were three measurements (and therefore three columns) - one in each axis.
a "t" prefix denotes that the data was collected in the time domain at a frequency of 50 Hz
a "f" prefix indicates that a fast fourier transform was applied so the data is in the frequency domain.
